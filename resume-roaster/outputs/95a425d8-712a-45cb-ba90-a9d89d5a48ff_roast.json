You've got a solid 88/100 overall, but that 30/100 Impact Score is screaming \"I exist, therefore I am employable\" energy. Let's fix this hot mess together!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **CONTENT ROAST**\n*\"I'm qualified... I think?\"*\n\nYou scored 100/100 on content quality but somehow forgot basic human contact information. It's like being a master chef who forgets to turn on the oven! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n**Why this hurts you:** Recruiters aren't psychic. When they want to call you for that dream job, they'll just move to the next candidate who remembered their phone number exists.\n\n**Fix it:** Add your phone number in the header like this:\n```\nJohn Smith | (555) 123-4567 | john.smith@email.com | LinkedIn.com/in/johnsmith\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **FORMATTING ROAST** \n*\"Consistency? I don't know her.\"*\n\n95/100 on formatting but your dates look like they were formatted by three different interns having an argument. Pick a lane and stay in it!\n\n**Why this hurts you:** Inconsistency makes you look careless. If you can't format dates consistently, how can they trust you with actual work details?\n\n**Fix it:** Choose ONE format and stick with it:\n- \u2705 \"Jan 2020 - Dec 2022\" \n- \u2705 \"January 2020 - December 2022\"\n- \u274c \"Jan 2020 - December 22\" (This chaos needs to stop)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 **ATS ROAST**\n*\"Special characters are my personality!\"*\n\nPerfect ATS score but you're still sprinkling special characters like confetti at a robot's birthday party. ATS systems have the reading comprehension of a tired toddler.\n\n**Why this hurts you:** Your resume might get rejected before human eyes even see it. Those fancy symbols turn into gibberish in ATS land.\n\n**Fix it:** \n- Replace bullets (\u2022, \u2605, \u25ba) with simple dashes (-)\n- Swap fancy quotes (\" \") with regular ones (\" \")\n- Keep it simple, robot-friendly\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca5 **IMPACT ROAST** \n*\"I showed up and did... stuff.\"*\n\n30/100 Impact Score? Ooof. Your resume reads like a grocery list instead of a highlight reel. You're not applying to be a human placeholder!\n\n**Why this hurts you:** Bland bullet points make you forgettable. Recruiters want to see what you ACHIEVED, not just what you were supposed to do.\n\n**Fix it:** Transform weak bullets into power moves:\n- \u274c \"Responsible for managing social media\"\n- \u2705 \"Increased social media engagement by 150% across 3 platforms, driving 2,000+ new leads monthly\"\n\nAdd numbers, percentages, dollar amounts - make them feel your impact! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **TOP 3 CRITICAL FIXES**\n\n1. **ADD YOUR PHONE NUMBER** - This is Resume 101, not optional\n2. **QUANTIFY EVERYTHING** - Turn every bullet point into a mini success story with numbers\n3. **Fix those wonky dates** - Pick a format, any format, just be consistent!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 **What You Actually Did Right**\n\nCredit where it's due - you nailed the one-page format (thank you for not making us read a novel), included your LinkedIn (modern human detected!), and showed relevant work experience. You've got the foundation; now let's build the wow factor! \n\nYour resume isn't broken, it just needs some personality and pizzazz to match that solid experience. You're closer than you think! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n*Now go forth and make that resume as impressive as you actually are!*\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n\ud83c\udfaf TOP 3 CRITICAL FIXES:\n1. Missing phone number: Add your phone number\n2. Inconsistent date formatting: Use consistent format like 'Jan 2020 - Dec 2022' throughout\n3. No professional summary or objective: Consider adding a brief 2-3 sentence summary highlighting your key qualifications\n\n\ud83d\udcaa WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT:\n\u2022 Includes LinkedIn profile link\n\u2022 Concise one-page format (ideal for most professionals)\n\u2022 Shows 4 relevant work experiences\n",
