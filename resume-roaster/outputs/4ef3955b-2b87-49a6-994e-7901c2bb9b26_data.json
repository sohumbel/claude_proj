You've mastered the art of being unreachable. It's like putting up a \"For Sale\" sign without a price tag. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**Why This Hurts You:** Recruiters aren't playing hide-and-seek. When they want to interview you ASAP, they'll call the next candidate who actually included their digits. You're literally ghosting yourself before the conversation even starts.\n\n**The Fix:** Add your phone number right under your name. Format it professionally: (555) 123-4567 or 555.123.4567. Revolutionary concept, I know! \ud83d\udcf1\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 FORMATTING FIASCO  \n**The Roast:** Your date formatting has more personality disorders than a reality TV show. Pick a lane and stay in it! \n\n**Why This Hurts You:** Inconsistency screams \"I don't pay attention to details\" \u2013 exactly what you DON'T want hiring managers thinking. If you can't format dates consistently, how can they trust you with important projects?\n\n**The Fix:** Choose ONE format and stick with it everywhere:\n- \u2705 \"Jan 2020 - Dec 2022\"\n- \u2705 \"01/2020 - 12/2022\"  \n- \u274c \"January 2020 - Dec 22\" (this chaos needs to stop)\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 ATS ARMAGEDDON\n**The Roast:** You've turned your resume into a special character soup that makes ATS systems cry tears of binary code. \n\n**Why This Hurts You:** Those fancy symbols and characters might look pretty, but they're making applicant tracking systems have an existential crisis. Your resume gets mangled faster than a sandwich in a blender.\n\n**The Fix:** \n- Replace \u2022 with simple hyphens (-)\n- Ditch fancy fonts for Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman\n- Save special characters for your poetry, not your paycheck pursuit\n\n## \ud83d\udca5 IMPACT IMPLOSION (THE BIG ONE!)\n**The Roast:** With a 30/100 impact score, your resume has about as much punch as a deflated balloon at a kid's birthday party. You're telling us WHAT you did, but not WHY anyone should care! \ud83c\udf88\ud83d\udca8\n\n**Why This Hurts You:** Generic job descriptions make you blend into the candidate crowd like a beige wall. Recruiters want to see results, achievements, and proof you're not just taking up office space.\n\n**The Fix - Transform Boring into BRILLIANT:**\n\n**Instead of:** \"Managed social media accounts\"\n**Write:** \"Managed 5 social media accounts, increasing follower engagement by 150% and driving 25% more website traffic over 6 months\"\n\n**Instead of:** \"Responsible for customer service\"\n**Write:** \"Resolved 50+ customer inquiries daily, maintaining 98% satisfaction rating and reducing complaint escalations by 30%\"\n\n**Formula:** Action Verb + Specific Task + Quantified Result = Impact Gold! \u2728\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udea8 TOP 3 CRITICAL FIXES \ud83d\udea8\n\n1. **ADD YOUR PHONE NUMBER** - You're not a mystery novel, be reachable! \ud83d\udcde\n2. **QUANTIFY EVERYTHING** - Numbers are your best friend. Show impact, not just activities! \ud83d\udcca\n3. **STANDARDIZE DATE FORMATS** - Pick one style and commit to the relationship! \ud83d\udcc5\n\n---\n\n# \ud83c\udfc6 GENUINE PROPS WHERE DUE \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**Credit where credit's due:** You nailed the one-page format (hiring managers everywhere thank you), your ATS compatibility is chef's kiss perfect, and you actually included your LinkedIn profile like a proper professional. Your content foundation is SOLID \u2013 now we just need to make it sing instead of whisper! \ud83c\udfb5\n\n**Bottom Line:** You're 70% of the way to resume greatness. These fixes will transform you from \"maybe pile\" to \"interview NOW\" status! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n\ud83c\udfaf TOP 3 CRITICAL FIXES:\n1. Missing phone number: Add your phone number\n2. Inconsistent date formatting: Use consistent format like 'Jan 2020 - Dec 2022' throughout\n3. No professional summary or objective: Consider adding a brief 2-3 sentence summary highlighting your key qualifications\n\n\ud83d\udcaa WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT:\n\u2022 Includes LinkedIn profile link\n\u2022 Concise one-page format (ideal for most professionals)\n\u2022 Shows 4 relevant work experiences\n",
